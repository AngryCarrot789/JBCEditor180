# JBCEditor180

This is a remake of BCEdit180, which I made a while ago, but I tried to refactor the code and kinda gave up after seeing 1000s of errors. This project I wanted to implement some new features and generally improve the old code base (e.g. support multiple selection editing, which works for method and field attributes at the moment)

I also hope to implement a text-based bytecode editor, and have a 'compiler' to turn the bytecode text into actual byte code because at the moment, the only editor is a list box based editor which is a slight hassle as there's no drag-dropping
